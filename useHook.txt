React Hooks Refresher – Your Developer Toolkit at a Glance
React Hooks are powerful — but even experienced devs benefit from a quick reminder now and then.
Here’s a compact rundown of the most-used ones 👇
🔁 useState
 Manages local state. When you need a value to change over time (like toggles, inputs, counters), this is your go-to.
📡 useEffect
 Handles side effects (data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM changes). Think: "do this when X changes."
📦 useContext
 Access shared/global state across deeply nested components without prop drilling. Perfect for themes, auth, language, etc.
🧠 useMemo
 Memoizes expensive computations so they don’t re-run unnecessarily. Ideal for optimizing performance-heavy calculations.
🔄 useCallback
 Returns the same function instance unless dependencies change — helps avoid unnecessary re-renders when passing functions as props.
🔎 useRef
 Keeps a persistent mutable reference between renders. Often used for DOM access or to store non-stateful values.
🎣 useReducer
 An alternative to useState for complex state logic or state that depends on previous values. Inspired by Redux patterns.
💡 Bonus tip: Think of useContext as the frontend cousin of global state or injected services — like a read-only API available anywhere in your component tree.
